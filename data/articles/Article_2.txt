Bitter cold, ice ravages red-cliffs in my veins, yet my mind holds invincible summer hues. O' Darkness thy black-hand my spirit restrains. Tho' thy power rages from thy dark Lord's pews.

Flee thee far back into thy dark Lord's abode, plead thy master, at Byrnhilda's rock for aid. Summer's warmth, my fiery embers sent explode. My Viking blood, proves I am iron made.

With such power I banish thee with one breath, tho' thy great wealth of evil is fierce and strong. Birthright, I draw residues from Odin's death. Epic strength and power from Valkyries's song.

Bitter cold, ice ravages red-cliffs in my veins, yet my mind holds invincible summer hues. O' Darkness thy black-hand my spirit restrains. Tho' thy power rages from thy dark Lord's pews.

Carry thy dark master this warning I send, with shields of truth, and armored Nordic powers. And with soul's all, and all my strength I defend. Against stones thrown from Dark Lord's brimstone towers.

When Valhalla's halls open for my passing, and Odin sits with mighty Thor at his side. Few will have entered in this pledge surpassing. Held firm, courage, loyalty and Viking pride.

Bitter cold, ice ravages red-cliffs in my veins, yet my mind holds invincible summer hues. O' Darkness thy black-hand my spirit restrains. Tho' thy power rages from thy dark Lord's pews.
