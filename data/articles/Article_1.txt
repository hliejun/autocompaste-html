To take each day as it comes, to gratefully praise The One. Joyfully face the new dawn’s grace, that's now my everyday plan.

To take each day as it comes, to guard my thought as it roams. On anything or anyone, that's now my everyday plan.

To take each day as it comes, to be careful with my words. To use the value of my hands, that's now my everyday plan.

To take each day as it comes, to do everything I can. And bring a smile to not just one, that's now my everyday plan.

To take each day as it comes, to celebrate other’s gain. Not consciously cause another's pain, that's now my everyday plan.

To take each day as it comes, not all the time comes the sun. For sorrow comes to everyone, and that I must understand.

To take each day as it comes, and know that I’m but a man. I will be glad, life’s not that bad, and do my part in God’s plan.
