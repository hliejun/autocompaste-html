Around midnight, in the library I found myself drawn, to these shelves haunted still by Poe, Stevenson and King. As a rare, late October storm brews beyond the pane, bringing life back to the creatures of Shelley and Stoker.

To these shelves, haunted still by Poe, Stevenson and King, my fingers grasp a book from under the dust and webs. Bringing life back, to the creatures of Shelley and Stoker, it's well-worn, leather spine just waiting to chill my own.

My fingers grasp a book, from under the dust and webs, while autumn winds rustle leaves like crisp, yellowed paper. It's well-worn leather spine, just waiting, to chill my own, my head, sinking further back into the velvet-lined chair.

While autumn winds rustle, leaves like crisp, yellowed paper, candlelight flickers dimly across the tattered old pages. My head sinking further, back into the velvet-lined chair, where the ghosts of Irving and Dickens will not let me sleep.

Candlelight flickers dimly, across the tattered, old pages, I, unable to recline, with the shadows thrown by the fire. Where the ghosts, of Irving and Dickens, will not let me sleep, residents of the dark welcome, and wait to be revisited.

I, unable to recline with the shadows, thrown by the fire, as a rare, late October storm brews, beyond the pane. Residents of the dark, welcome and wait, to be revisited, around midnight, in the library, I found myself, drawn.
