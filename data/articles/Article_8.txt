Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, in the dead vast and middle of the night, been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father, armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, appears before them, and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd by their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, within his truncheon's length. Whilst they, distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear, stand dumb and speak not to him.

This to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did; and I with them the third night kept the watch. Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, form of the thing, each word made true and good, the apparition comes: I knew your father; these hands are not more like.

My lord, I did; but answer made it none: yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion, like as it would speak. But even then the morning cock crew loud, and at the sound it shrunk in haste away, and vanish'd from our sight.
